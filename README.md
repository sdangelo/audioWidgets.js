audioWidgets.html.

## TODO:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/devicePixelRatio;
* exploit JS class inheritance in web components?
* add Web MIDI API events;
* use polyfills where needed?
* review API;
* offscreen rendering;
* better graphics;
* optimizations;
* documentation;
* better examples;
* translate to Web Components?
* accessibility;
* move scope/spectrum analyser here from canvasPlot.js?
* themeing?
* minified version.
