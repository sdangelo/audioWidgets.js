# audioWidgets.js
Minimal HTML5 Canvas/JavaScript library of GUI widgets for audio applications.

I am too lazy to explain hows and whys, just take a look at the example file
audioWidgets.html.

## TODO:

* add touch events;
* add Web MIDI API events;
* use polyfills where needed?
* review API;
* offscreen rendering;
* better graphics;
* optimizations;
* documentation;
* better examples;
* translate to Web Components?
* accessibility;
* move scope/spectrum analyser here from canvasPlot.js?
* themeing?
* minified version.
