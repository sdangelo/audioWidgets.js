# virtualPianoKeyboard.js
Minimal HTML5 Canvas/JavaScript piano keyboard.

I am too lazy to explain hows and whys, just take a look at the example files:
* virtualPianoKeyboard - 25 keys piano keyboard;
* trivialSynth - trivial monophonic synth (Web Audio API based).

## TODO:

* add touch events;
* add Web MIDI API events;
* use polyfills where needed?
* review API;
* better graphics;
* documentation.
